NFV:
1.	Listen to client for URL
2.	Do URL to IP mapping using internal DNS (which uses set in C++) Query for URL to all servers
3.	Send ARP like query packet using the IP address from internal DNS.
4.	Listen for ACK from servers.
5.	Decide load distribution
6.	Send client port and IP address, file number and range along with get content command to servers.

Server:
1.	Hard code NFV client side IP address:
2.	Divide content to file chunks in folder
3.	Interface for each content IP.  Search from a table of content IP addresses.
4.	Listen for ;
a.	Query for content
i.	Compute load. 
ii.	Donâ€™t reply if load is higher than threshold!
iii.	Send ACK (also contains load).
b.	Get content:
i.	Select files
ii.	Calls scapy with source IP address of NFV and destination IP of client
iii.	Send files.
1.	Use NFVs client side IP address as source IP address to send packet
2.	Use proper offset number based on file chunk number.
3.	Send file directly to client. Send to server. Server will store and forward or change the headers.


Client:
1.	Hopefully do nothing!
